# FitBuddy

## 💡 Inspiration
Many students struggle to stay active and maintain healthy habits, especially with the modern challenges of:

- Busy schedules with school, homework, and extracurricular activities  
- Excessive screen time from phones, computers, and gaming  
- Limited access to fitness guidance, gyms, or affordable programs  

I realized that many teens want to stay healthy but lack a simple, friendly way to get started. I wanted to create a digital coach that is approachable, motivating, and easy to use, helping students build healthy habits that can last a lifetime.

The goal of FitBuddy is to **empower teens to stay active, reduce stress, and track their personal growth**, all without needing a gym membership, expensive equipment, or a personal trainer.
